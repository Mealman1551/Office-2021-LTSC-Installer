***Download at end of Readme.***

## Installation

- Office will be installed in your OS main language.
- After installation, Office may show [this warning](https://i.ibb.co/ZGLXjxb/Schermafbeelding-2024-08-22-094545.png). If that's the case please use `Meal's Office Activator.exe`.
- If Microsoft Defender blocks the or delete the `.exe`, use the `sign exe.bat` batch file to sign it again. (Ensure "Hidden items" is enabled).

## Safety and Security

To ensure the integrity of the files, you can verify their hashes:

- **Hash for installer**: `dc6b2dcfd9568a3f71c5297af342135f0d3706a33d7cf33a238271483e7248f4`
- **Hash for activator**: `ddf030a283059520057382c31ee11835ddd4695761fb51e311136c989f06bfd5`

To check the hashes, use the `Verify Hash.bat` in the downloaded folder.
Is it safe? well... no... but actually yes... ugh of course, it's open-source, see the code of the `Verify Hash.bat` [here](https://gist.github.com/Mealman1551/8495c117a79b35cf6aadf20130fef9a3)

## About the Zip-Archive

The Zip archive is created with WinRAR and the compression method is set to _Good_ to ensure a good, smooth and seamless unpacking process on any Windows version and with any Zip software. In the future I will compress in _Best_ mode but for now it is on _Good_.
